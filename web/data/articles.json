Each role can run on a separate inference node, allowing the system to continue publishing even if one model route degrades.</p><h3>Quality Controls</h3><p>The pipeline removes reasoning artifacts, enforces publication-safe copy, and normalizes style. Legacy feed entries can be rewritten automatically to keep voice and formatting consistent across the homepage.</p><h3>Operations</h3><p>Background jobs manage generation cadence, health checks and optional repository sync. The frontend reads from this JSON feed and renders article cards and detail pages without requiring a dynamic backend.</p>",
